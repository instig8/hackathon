                    For detailed information, the <a href="https://www.sit.edu/about/directions/">directions page for SIT has great detailed information</a>. In short, if you are flying in to Boston or Bradley, you can rent a car, take a few busses, or hire transportation shuttle. If you're coming from NYC, there is an amtrak train.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We'll be coordinating carpools and transportation with registrants to keep costs low and keep things simple.
